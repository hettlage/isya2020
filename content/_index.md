## Welcome to Cape Town

The International School for Young Astronomers (ISYA) 2020 will be held in Cape Town, South Africa from 22 Nov to 11 Dec 2020. The school is organized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters (NASL) and by the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). This school will take place over a three-week period and is specifically aimed towards early graduate students (MSc/PhD) in Physics, Astronomy or Astrophysics from African countries. The lecturers are invited experts from around the world.

Around 30 students will be selected to participate in this school. These chosen students will be from regions where less opportunities are available for students to be directly exposed to the full extent of up-to-date astrophysics, both on theory and observations. Acceptance to the school covers flights to and from South Africa (including domestic flights) and accommodation at the ISYA. All selected students are expected to commit 100% of their time to participate in all the planned activities during the school.

## LOC and SOC
